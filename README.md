Fundamentals of machine learning and data analysis using Python

This GitHub repository is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about the fundamentals of machine learning and data analysis using Python.

The repository covers the basics of machine learning, including an overview of what machine learning is, as well as the fundamental tasks of machine learning. It also introduces important machine learning vocabulary such as points, dimension, hyperparameters, and problem complexity.

The repository provides an introduction to the fundamental packages used in data science, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. It also includes examples of different types of tasks that can be processed with datasets, such as classification, regression, and clustering.

The basis of exploratory data analysis is also covered in this repository, with a focus on statistics and correlations. This includes an overview of different types of statistical tests and how to use them to explore data.

Additionally, the repository explains the difference between rule-based algorithms and machine learning algorithms, and provides examples of each. It also includes a step-by-step guide on how to train and run K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), a popular classification algorithm, using Python and Scikit-learn.
